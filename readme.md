# Modernizr example

Mobile feature test example. For quick test, just enter [http://localhost:3000/test](http://localhost:3000/test) after fire up express server.

[Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/docs/#what-is-modernizr) is a feature detection library, not a browser sniffer like [mobile-detect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mobile-detect). However, I will combine the two for completely detection.
